  lyrics: |
    When I think about the Lord
    How He saved me
    How He raised me
    How He filled me up with the Holy Ghost
    How He healed me to the uttermost
    When I think about the Lord
    How He picked me up and turned me around
    And set my feet on solid ground
    It makes me wanna shout hallelujah
    Thank you Jesus
    Lord You’re worthy of all the glory
    All the honor
    All the praise
    All the praise
    All the praise
