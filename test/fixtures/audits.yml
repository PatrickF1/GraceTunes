      VERSE 1:
                C
      You are good, You are good
      And there's nothing good in me
               G/C
      You are love, You are love
      On display for all to see
                C
      You are light, You are light
      When the darkness closes in
              G/C
      You are hope, You are hope
      You've covered all my sin

      VERSE 2:
               C
      You are peace, You are peace
      When my fear is crippling
               G/C
      You are truth, You are truth
      Even in my wandering
               C
      You are joy, You are joy
      You're the reason that I sing
              G/C
      You are life, You are life
      In You death has lost it's sting

      CHORUS:
       C                               G             Am
      I'm running to Your arms, I'm running to Your arms
                                               F
      The riches of Your love will always be enough
                     Am        G      F
      And nothing compares to Your embrace
                     Am      G      F
      Light of the world, Forever reign

      VERSE 3:
               C
      You are more, You are more
      Than my words will ever say
               G/C
      You are Lord, You are Lord
      All creation will proclaim
               C
      You are here, You are here
      In Your presence I'm made whole
              G/C
      You are God, You are God
      Of all else I'm letting go

      BRIDGE:
      Am             F
      My heart will sing
                C
      No other name
              G/B
      Jesus, Jesus
